Database-Python-Scripting,What is it about?

Well im a newbie in python,still trying to learn it. As a learner, i made this project which includes working on MySql
and Python 2.7.
What this script actually do is, it lets user store its information in a specific database which can be deleted and updated later on.
Apart from that it stores information about user's HVD record. List down all the users associated to HVD or not associated users.
